# Bank-Management-System
This Java project is a simple bank management system that allows users to manage bank accounts through a console-based interface. It simulates the operations of a bank, where users can create, view, modify, and close accounts. The system supports different types of accounts (e.g., saving and other types), and it handles various operations such as depositing and withdrawing money. The bank system reads account data from a file at startup, allowing it to work with pre-existing account information. Users can perform operations such as adding new accounts, viewing details of all accounts, adding or withdrawing money from specific accounts, modifying account details, and closing accounts. The system ensures that operations like withdrawals are subject to certain constraints based on the account type, such as limits on withdrawal amounts for saving accounts. The updated account data can be saved back to the file when the program exits, ensuring data persistence across sessions. This project provides a basic but functional framework for managing bank accounts programmatically, suitable for learning purposes or small-scale banking simulations.
